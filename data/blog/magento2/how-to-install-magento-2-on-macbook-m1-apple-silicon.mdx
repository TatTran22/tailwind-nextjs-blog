## Overview

- [Homebrew](#install-homebrew)
- [Git](#install-git)
- [MYSQL](#install-mysql)
- [PHP](#install-php)
- [Nginx](#install-nginx)
- [Composer](#install-composer)
- [Elasticsearch](#install-elasticsearch)
- [Magento 2](#install-magento-2)

## Install Homebrew

The Package Manager for macOS.

### macOS Requirements

- A 64-bit Intel CPU or Apple Silicon CPU
- macOS Mojave (10.14) (or higher)
- Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode: `xcode-select --install`, [developer.apple.com/downloads](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) or [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
- A Bourne-compatible shell for installation (e.g. bash or zsh)

```bash:Terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into `/usr/local` for macOS Intel, `/opt/homebrew` for Apple Silicon.

## Install Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

```bash:Terminal
brew install git
```

That will install latest version of git.

## Install MYSQL

```bash:Terminal
brew install mysql
```

You can now start the MySQL server by running:

```bash:Terminal
brew services start mysql
```

Now we need to secure the MySQL server. By default the server comes without a root password, so we need to make sure it’s protected.

Run:

```bash:Terminal
mysql_secure_installation
```

The procedure can take a while, but it gives a lot of power to make sure you get the best defaults out of the box:

![mysql_secure_installation](/static/images/install_magento/install-mysql.png)

Since we used `brew services start mysql` to start MySQL, your Mac will re-start it at reboot. You can run:

```bash:Terminal
brew services stop mysql
```

to stop this from happening, and also to immediately stop MySQL.

You can also avoid this daemon mode (that’s what we call programs that always run in the background and restart when the computer is restarted) by running:

```bash:Terminal
mysql.server start
```

This will start MySQL and will keep it running until the computer is shut down, or until you run:

```bash:Terminal
mysql.server stop
```

and it will not re-start it at reboot.

It’s up to you to decide which one you prefer.

Now you can connect to the server using the command:

```bash:Terminal
mysql -u root -p
```

You will need to type the **root** user password after you run this command, and once you are done you should see this screen:

![mysql](/static/images/install_magento/install-mysql2.png)

### Configuring the Magento database instance

This section discusses how to create a new database instance for Magento. Although a new database instance is recommended, you can optionally install Magento into an existing database instance.

To configure a MySQL database instance:

Log in to your database server as any user.
Get to a MySQL command prompt:

```bash:Terminal
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the MySQL root user’s password when prompted.
Enter the following commands in the order shown to create a database instance named **mage2ce** with username **magento**:

```sql:Query
create database mage2ce;
```

```sql:Query(Optional)
create user 'magento'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'magento';
```

```sql:Query(Optional)
GRANT ALL ON mage2ce.* TO 'magento'@'localhost';
```

```sql:Query
flush privileges;
```

Enter `exit` to quit the command prompt.

## Install PHP

```bash:Terminal
brew install php@7.4
```

### Verify PHP is installed

Most flavors of Linux have PHP installed by default. This topic assumes that you have already installed PHP. To verify if PHP is installed already, in the command line, type:

```bash:Terminal
php -v
```

If PHP is installed, a message similar to the following displays:

```bash:Terminal
PHP 7.4.21 (cli) (built: Jul 12 2021 03:04:54) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
    with Zend OPcache v7.4.21, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
```

Magento 2.4 is compatible with PHP 7.3, but we test with, and recommend using, PHP 7.4.

### Check PHP settings

#### Step 1: Find PHP configuration files

This section discusses how you find the configuration files necessary to update required settings.

- Find `php.ini` configuration file

To locate the PHP command-line configuration, enter

```bash:Terminal
php --ini | grep "Loaded Configuration File"
```

- Find OPcache configuration settings
  PHP OPcache settings are typically located either in php.ini or opcache.ini. The location might depend on your operating system and PHP version. The OPcache configuration file might have an opcache section or settings like opcache.enable.

Use the following guidelines to find it:

- Nginx web server:

OPcache settings are typically located in `/opt/homebrew/etc/php/7.4/conf.d/ext-opcache.ini`

If not, use the following command to locate it:

```bash:Terminal
sudo find / -name 'opcache.ini'
```

PHP-FPM: `/opt/homebrew/etc/php/7.4/php.ini`

If you have more than one `opcache.ini`, modify all of them.

#### Step 2: How to set PHP options

To set PHP options:

1. Open a php.ini in a text editor.
2. Locate your server’s time zone in the available [time zone settings](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php)
3. Locate the following setting and uncomment it if necessary:

```text:php.ini
date.timezone =
```

4. Add the time zone setting you found in step 2.
5. Change the value of memory_limit to one of the values recommended at the beginning of this section.
   For example,

```text:php.ini
memory_limit=2G
```

6. Add or update the realpath_cache configuration to match the following values:

```text:php.ini
;
; Increase realpath cache size
;
realpath_cache_size = 10M

;
; Increase realpath cache ttl
;
realpath_cache_ttl = 7200
```

7. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
8. Open the other php.ini (if they are different) and make the same changes in it.

#### Step 3: Set OPcache options

To set opcache.ini options:

1. Open your OPcache configuration file in a text editor:
2. Locate `opcache.save_comments` and uncomment it if necessary.
3. Make sure its value is set to 1.
4. Save your changes and exit the text editor.

## Install Nginx

```bash:Terminal
brew install nginx
```

Start Nginx service by running:

```bash:Terminal
brew services start nginx
```

## Install Composer

```bash:Terminal
brew install composer
```

Check the version of Composer installed by running:

```bash:Terminal
composer -V
```

You will see the version and build information of Composer installed.

```bash:Terminal
Composer version 2.1.5 2021-07-23 10:35:47
```

## Install Elasticsearch

### Install Rosetta

You must install Rosetta 2 as some binaries are still Darwin/AMD64. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:

```bash:Terminal
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

To install with Homebrew, you first need to tap the Elastic Homebrew repository:

```bash:Terminal
brew tap elastic/tap
```

Once you’ve tapped the Elastic Homebrew repo, you can use brew install to install the latest version of Elasticsearch:

Obtaining Elasticsearch for Docker is as simple as issuing a docker pull command against the Elastic Docker registry. We will install Elasticsearch version 7.9.3 because this is the highest version that Magento supports.

```bash:Terminal
brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
```

Config files locationedit
Elasticsearch has three configuration files:

- **elasticsearch.yml** for configuring Elasticsearch
- **jvm.options** for configuring Elasticsearch JVM settings
- **log4j2.properties** for configuring Elasticsearch logging

Start Elasticsearch service by running the following command:

```bash:Terminal
brew services start elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
```

The image exposes TCP ports 9200 and 9300

## Install Magento 2

We first need to navigate to the web directory of our web server:

```bash:Terminal
cd /opt/homebrew/var/www
```

Create a new Composer project using the Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce metapackage.

```bash:Terminal
 composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition mage2ce
```

When prompted, enter your Magento authentication keys. Public and private keys are created and configured in your [Magento Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/).

### Install Magento

You must use the command line to install Magento.

This example assumes that the Magento install directory is named mage2ce, the db-host is on the same machine (localhost), and that the db-name, db-user, and db-password are all magento:

```bash:Terminal: /opt/homebrew/var/www/mage2ce
bin/magento setup:install \
--base-url="http://mage2ce.local/" \
--db-host=localhost \
--db-name=mage2ce \
--db-user='root' \
--db-password=123456 \
--admin-firstname="Admin" \
--admin-lastname="admin" \
--admin-email=admin@admin.com \
--admin-user=admin \
--admin-password=admin123 \
--language=en_US \
--currency=USD \
--timezone=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh \
--use-rewrites=1 \
--backend-frontname="admin" \
--search-engine=elasticsearch7 \
--elasticsearch-host=localhost \
--elasticsearch-port=9200
```

Messages similar to the following display to indicate a successful installation:

```bash:Terminal
Post installation file permissions check...
For security, remove write permissions from these directories: '/opt/homebrew/var/www/mage2ce/app/etc'
[Progress: 274 / 274]
[SUCCESS]: Magento installation complete.
[SUCCESS]: Admin Panel URI: /admin
```

Create configuration file for Nginx with path `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/mage2ce.local.config`

```config:/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers/mage2ce.local.config
upstream fastcgi_backend {
  server   127.0.0.1:9074;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mage2ce.local;
    set $MAGE_ROOT /opt/homebrew/var/www/mage2ce;
    set $MAGE_MODE developer;

    error_log /opt/homebrew/var/www/mage2ce/var/log/mage2ce.local-error.log;
    include /opt/homebrew/var/www/mage2ce/nginx.conf.sample;
}
```

Check syntax of the configuration file of Nginx by running:

```bash:Terminal
nginx -t
```

Reload the configuration file by running:

```bash:Terminal
nginx -s reload
```

Restart Nginx server by running:

```bash:Terminal
brew services restart nginx
```

We need to edit the hosts file so that the mage2ce.local domain can run on the local machine.

```bash:Terminal
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

Add the following line:

```bash:Terminal
127.0.0.1       mage2ce.local
```

### Switch to Developer Mode

It’s time to switch Magento to Developer Mode. Magento has 3 modes, all designed to use optimal settings based on your usage. In Developer Mode, you can access more tools in the backend of Magento than any other mode. I’ve covered these Modes in more depth video that you’ll find on the channel

Switch modes using

```bash:Terminal
bin/magento deploy:mode:set developer
```

Clear the cached generated folders

```bash:Terminal
rm -rf generated/metadata/* generated/code/*
```

Clear the remaining cache

```bash:Terminal
bin/magento cache:clean
```

### Verify the installation

Go to the storefront in a web browser. For example, if your Magento installation base URL is http://mage2ce.local/, enter it in your browser’s address or location bar.

The following figure shows a sample storefront page. If it displays as follows, your installation was a success!
![Verify the storefront (no sample data)](https://devdocs.magento.com/common/images/install-success_store.png)

### Download Sample Data via Composer

Magento has a really useful command for installing all of the sample data from the Magento Repository via Composer. This step can normally take a couple of minutes to complete. At times, it may appear that nothing is happening, but just give it time.

The the Sample Data installation script

```bash:Terminal
bin/magento sampledata:deploy
```

It’s been a couple of minutes and now Putty is awaiting our next command. We need to tell Magento to install the latest changes we’ve just made [44:14]

```bash:Terminal
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

Verify the storefront (with optional sample data)
Go to the storefront in a web browser. For example, if your Magento installation base URL is http://mage2ce.local/, enter it in your browser’s address or location bar.

The following figure shows a sample storefront page. If it displays as follows, your installation was a success!
